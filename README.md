# P'tit Pot Bot
## Running app locally

Before you start, you'll need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [create a Discord app](https://discord.com/developers/applications) with the proper permissions:
- `applications.commands`
- `bot` (with Send Messages enabled)


Configuring the app is covered in detail in the [getting started guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started).


### Setup project

First clone the project:
Then navigate to its directory and install dependencies:

```
docker-compose up -d --build --force-recreate --no-deps
```

### Docker usage

```
docker-compose up -d --build --force-recreate --no-deps
```
or :
```
docker-compose up -d
```

Usefull docker-compose commands :### Run the app

After your credentials are added, go ahead and run the app:

```
node app.js
```

> ⚙️ A package [like `nodemon`](https://github.com/remy/nodemon), which watches for local changes and restarts your app, may be helpful while locally developing.

If you aren't following the [getting started guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started), you can move the contents of `examples/app.js` (the finished `app.js` file) to the top-level `app.js`.

```
docker-compose restart ptitpot

docker-compose down --volumes

docker-compose logs -f ptitpote

docker-compose exec ptitpote bash
```

### Get app credentials

Fetch the credentials from your app's settings and add them to a `.env` file (see `.env.sample` for an example). You'll need your app ID (`APP_ID`), bot token (`BOT_TOKEN`), and public key (`PUBLIC_KEY`).

Fetching credentials is covered in detail in the [getting started guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started).

> 🔑 Environment variables can be added to the `.env` file in Glitch or when developing locally, and in the Secrets tab in Replit (the lock icon on the left).

### Install slash commands

The commands for the example app are set up in `commands.js`. All of the commands in the `ALL_COMMANDS` array at the bottom of `commands.js` will be installed when you run the `register` command configured in `package.json`:

```
docker-compose exec ptitpote npm run register
```

### Local tunnel with docker environment  

Try to use tunnel services like ngrok, localtunnel, etc...

Copy the forwarding address that starts with `https`, in this case `https://<LOCALTUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN>.loca.lt`, then go to your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

On the **General Information** tab, there will be an **Interactions Endpoint URL**. Paste your ngrok address there, and append `/interactions` to it (`https://<LOCALTUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN>.loca.lt/interactions` in the example).

Click **Save Changes**, and your app should be ready to run 🚀
